The idea 

From the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals

As we can see that

Numbers 1 - 9 
no common pattern. We should calculate it one by one

Numbers 10 - 19
no common pattern. We we should calculate it one by one

20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90,
no common pattern. We should calculate it one by one


All numbers between 1- 999 can be writen in combination from previously
calculated numbers.
